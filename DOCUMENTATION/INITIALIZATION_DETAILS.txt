The initialization file contains a list of particles, with their attributes in a tab-separated format.  Comments begin with a pound sign and span the entire line.  The proper format for a particle is the particle declaration, followed by tab-separated variable-value pairs.

PARTICLE
{
MASS		(in kilograms)
CHARGE		(in Coulombs)
RADIUS		(in meters)
XPOS		(in meters)
YPOS		(in meters)
ZPOS		(in meters)
XVEL		(in meters per second)
YVEL		(in meters per second)
ZVEL		(in meters per second)
}

Note that MASS and RADIUS should be non-zero numbers, or else the simulation results will be rather useless.  The parameters do not have to be specified in order, but they must all be present.
